<script type="text/javascript">

    function init() { //our canvas function 
        const canvas = document.getElementById('webgl-canvas'); //Gets the ID of a HTML element 
        // Ensure we have a canvas
        if (!canvas) { // IF you can't find the canvas then throw an error (or if browser doesn't support it)

        }
        const gl = canvas.getContext('webgl2');// Has canvas as a constant so that it's unchangable

            ? 'Hooray! You got a WebGL2 context' // If the browser finds a canvas
