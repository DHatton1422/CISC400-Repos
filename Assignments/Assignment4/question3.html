pseudo code


//Set our matrix (Matrix4)
//Vertices for each face of the square (front,back,side,up,down, etc)
//set our indices to connect the points and draw a cube 
//set the color of each verticie (different for each or random)
//create matrix/vertice/indice/color buffers 
//add them into our vshader/fshader
//setRotate(90, 1,1,1) for matrix (so it rotates around the x and y axis)
