    pseudo code question 1 

    Set num of vertices     n = 1 
    Set vertices cords to 0.0 

    Grab current time (or set the time to 10 seconds) 

    setTranslate(currenttime, tx, ty,tz) 

    draw()  (POINTS)

    If (var i = o; n >= canvas (size of canvas); i++) {
        n == 0.0; (set points location back to 0)

    }

    Have to calculate distance etc but I have no idea how to do this. The book is
    not helping. I'm unsure if my current logic is correct.
